    "LSA for natural language processing task was introduced by Jerome Bellegarda in 2005. The objective of LSA is reducing dimension for classification. The idea is that words will occurs in similar pieces of text if they have similar meaning. We usually use Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) as an alternative name in NLP field.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we have m documents and n words as input. An m * n matrix can be constructed while column and row are document and word respectively. You can use count occurrence or TF-IDF score. However, TF-IDF is better than count occurrence in most of the time as high frequency do not account for better classification."
